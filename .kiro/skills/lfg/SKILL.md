Run these slash commands in order. Do not do anything else. Do not stop between steps — complete every step through to the end.

1. **Optional:** If the `ralph-wiggum` skill is available, run the ralph-wiggum-ralph-loop skill "finish all slash commands" --completion-promise "DONE"`. If not available or it fails, skip and continue to step 2 immediately.
2. the workflows-plan skill $ARGUMENTS`
3. the compound-engineering-deepen-plan skill
4. the workflows-work skill
5. the workflows-review skill
6. the compound-engineering-resolve_todo_parallel skill
7. the compound-engineering-test-browser skill
8. the compound-engineering-feature-video skill
9. Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` when video is in PR

Start with step 2 now (or step 1 if ralph-wiggum is available).
